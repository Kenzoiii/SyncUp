# ðŸŒ€ SyncUp

**Project Description:**  
SyncUp is a simple yet powerful tool designed to solve a common problem in group projects â€” staying aligned.  
Itâ€™s not a complex project manager, but a streamlined hub where teammates can publicly log their progress in real-time.  
By providing a single source of truth for who has checked in and when, SyncUp eliminates communication bottlenecks and fosters a culture of accountability.  
The result is a more organized and stress-free team, ensuring everyone is on the same rhythm and moving toward the same goal.
